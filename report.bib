abstract = {This paper shows that a fundamental Gaussian beam propagating in a lenslike medium with cylindrical symmetry can be generated by the rotation about its axis of a skew ray which obeys the laws of geometrical optics. A complex representation: X(z) $=$ $\xi$(z) $+$ j$\eta$(z), where $\xi$(z) and $\eta$(z) are the projections of the skew ray on two perpendicular meridional planes, is discussed. It is found that the beam radius is equal to the modulus of X(z) and the on-axis phase to the phase of X(z). Using this representation, we derive a general expression for the on-axis phase shift $\Delta$$\Phi$ experienced by a beam with an input complex beam parameter q through an optical system whose ray matrix is \[ABCD\]:$\Delta$$\Phi$$=$phase of(A$+$B/q). When the beam is matched to the optical system (output q $=$ q), $\Delta$$\Phi$ can be written cos--1(A $+$ D)/2. This representation also provides a useful beam tracing method which is demonstrated and a simple interpretation for the known representation of Gaussian modes by ray packets.},

	abstract = {Scalar fields can be propagated through non-paraxial systems using the Gaussian beam decomposition method. However, for high NA objectives, this scalar treatment is not sufficient to correctly describe the electromagnetic fields inside the focal region due to high ray bendings, which result in a significant change in the polarization state of light. To model these vectorial effects, the Gaussian beam decomposition method has to be extended to include the polarization state of light. In this work we have combined it with the three dimensional polarization ray tracing in order to propagate vectorial fields through high NA optical systems. During the Gaussian beam decomposition, the polarization state of each individual beamlet is represented by a polarization vector [������������, ������������, ������������] associated with its central ray. Individual Gaussian beams are then propagated through the system using the complex ray tracing method. The effect of the optical system on the polarization state of each beam is computed by applying the three dimensional polarization ray tracing of the corresponding central rays. Finally the individual beams are superposed coherently in the plane of interest resulting in the complete vectorial field. We apply the proposed method to compute the vectorial field inside the focal region of a high NA microscope objective lens and compare our result to the vectorial Debye integral method. We find that the Gaussian beam decomposition method overcomes serious limitations of algorithms relying on Fourier transforms, i.e. the field sampling requirements are less critical in high NA focusing and in the presence of large aberrations. However, sharp edges in the amplitude profile are difficult to handle as they should be replaced with smooth Gaussian edge.},

	abstract = {The Optimal Optical Coronagraph (OOC) Workshop at the Lorentz Center in September 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands gathered a diverse group of 25 researchers working on exoplanet instrumentation to stimulate the emergence and sharing of new ideas. In this ﬁrst installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from oﬀ-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would beneﬁt our community to clearly deﬁne quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection signiﬁcance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise.},

	abstract = {HST provides an unparalleled venue for high contrast imaging which has enabled new observational domains in exoplanet and debris disk imaging. Unburdened by atmospheric "seeing", NICMOS and STIS achieve very low levels of background contamination from the wings of stellar point spread functions (PSF). Coronagraphy provides additional contrast gains approaching an order of magnitude at small angular distances from occulted stars. The stability of the platform allows scattered and diffracted light to be further reduced by two additional orders of magnitude through PSFsubtraction. The non-destructive read-out modes of the NICMOS detectors permit sampling the PSF, with its strong radial brightness gradient, over a dynamic range exceeding 5x107 in a single spacecraft orbit. In H-band, sub-stellar companions of ∆H ≈ 8 + 2 × (angular separation in arcseconds) are unambiguously detected in twenty minutes of integration (e.g., a 10 Myr "hot Jupiter" at 2.5 arcseconds from an occulted star). Raw sensitivity metrics, such as presumtively static Strehl ratios, are often invoked in comparing the performance of different instrumental systems but belie the true detectability levels which are dominated by systemic non-repeatable PSF variations (not photon statistics). Such variations can give rise to false detections of companions (and circumstellar disks) and introduce very significant photometric errors. The ability to rotate the HST field with high precision about the target axis and acquire temporally stable reference PSFs readily permits the identification and rejection of rotationally-invariant optical artifacts. We discuss the repeatable, quantifiable performance limits routinely reached by HST (currently unachievable on groundbased systems), for which PSF stability is critical.},

	abstract = {The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument is an extremely modular high-contrast instrument installed on the Subaru telescope in Hawaii. SCExAO has a dual purpose. Its position in the northern hemisphere on a 8-meter telescope makes it a prime instrument for the detection and characterization of exoplanets and stellar environments over a large portion of the sky. In addition, SCExAO's unique design makes it the ideal instrument to test innovative technologies and algorithms quickly in a laboratory setup and subsequently deploy them on-sky. SCExAO benefits from a first stage of wavefront correction with the facility adaptive optics AO188, and splits the 600-2400 nm spectrum towards a variety of modules, in visible and near infrared, optimized for a large range of science cases. The integral field spectrograph CHARIS, with its J, H or K-band high-resolution mode or its broadband low-resolution mode, makes SCExAO a prime instrument for exoplanet detection and characterization. Here we report on the recent developments and scientific results of the SCExAO instrument. Recent upgrades were performed on a number of modules, like the visible polarimetric module VAMPIRES, the high-performance infrared coronagraphs, various wavefront control algorithms, as well as the real-time controller of AO188. The newest addition is the 20k-pixel Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKIDS) Exoplanet Camera (MEC) that will allow for previously unexplored science and technology developments. MEC, coupled with novel photon-counting speckle control, brings SCExAO closer to the final design of future high-contrast instruments optimized for Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs).},

The functional form of these aberrations, called polarization aberrations, result from the angles of incidence and the variations of the coatings as a function of angle. These coatings induce small modifications to the PSF, which consists of four separate components, two nearly Airy-disk PSF components, and two faint components, we call ghost PSF components, with a spatial extent about twice the size of the diffraction limited image. As the specifications of optical systems constantly improve, these small effects become increasingly important. It is shown how the magnitude of these ghost PSF components, at {\textasciitilde}10-5 in the example telescope, can interfere with exoplanet detection with coronagraphs.},

These new coronagraphs provide a key advance to enabling direct imaging and spectroscopy of Earth twins with future large space missions. Building on shaped pupil (SP) apodization optimizations, our approach enables two-dimensional optimizations of the system to address any aperture features such as central obstruction, support structures, or segment gaps. We illustrate the technique with a design that could reach a 1010 contrast level at 34 mas for a 12 m segmented telescope over a 10\% bandpass centered at a wavelength of l0 = 500 nm. These designs can be optimized speciﬁcally for the presence of a resolved star and, in our example, for stellar angular size up to 1.1 mas. This would allow one to probe the vicinity of Sun-like stars located beyond 4.4 pc, therefore, fully retiring this concern. If the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is hÅ = 0.1, with 18\% throughput, assuming a perfect, stable wavefront and considering photon noise only, 12.5 exo-Earth candidates could be detected around nearby stars with this design and a 12 m space telescope during a ﬁve-year mission with two years dedicated to exo-Earth detection (one total year of exposure time and another year of overheads). Our new hybrid APLC/SP solutions represent the ﬁrst numerical solution of a coronagraph based on existing mask technologies and compatible with segmented apertures, and that can provide contrast compatible with detecting and studying Earth-like planets around nearby stars. They represent an important step forward toward enabling these science goals with future large space missions.},

	abstract = {Scalar fields can be propagated through non-paraxial systems using the Gaussian beam decomposition method. However, for high NA objectives, this scalar treatment is not sufficient to correctly describe the electromagnetic fields inside the focal region due to high ray bendings, which result in a significant change in the polarization state of light. To model these vectorial effects, the Gaussian beam decomposition method has to be extended to include the polarization state of light. In this work we have combined it with the three dimensional polarization ray tracing in order to propagate vectorial fields through high NA optical systems. During the Gaussian beam decomposition, the polarization state of each individual beamlet is represented by a polarization vector [������������, ������������, ������������] associated with its central ray. Individual Gaussian beams are then propagated through the system using the complex ray tracing method. The effect of the optical system on the polarization state of each beam is computed by applying the three dimensional polarization ray tracing of the corresponding central rays. Finally the individual beams are superposed coherently in the plane of interest resulting in the complete vectorial field. We apply the proposed method to compute the vectorial field inside the focal region of a high NA microscope objective lens and compare our result to the vectorial Debye integral method. We find that the Gaussian beam decomposition method overcomes serious limitations of algorithms relying on Fourier transforms, i.e. the field sampling requirements are less critical in high NA focusing and in the presence of large aberrations. However, sharp edges in the amplitude profile are difficult to handle as they should be replaced with smooth Gaussian edge.},

For example, ray-based models allow predictions to be made regarding the changes to a measurement when aberrations are introduced into the input wavefront. However, there are other aspects that are more difficult (or impossible) to model well with ray-based approaches. For instance, when a surface under test is not conjugate to the detector, the effects due to diffraction from the edge of the surface cannot be modeled with ray-based approaches. Modern lens design software generally includes tools for modeling beam propagation. These tools can be used to go beyond conventional ray-based modeling of interferometers. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of these beam propagation tools by modeling various aspects of a point-diffraction interferometer that go beyond solely ray-based approaches.},

The essential idea of this algorithm is to decompose arbitrary beam into a small number of elliptical Gaussian beams, which is similar but different from existing diffracted Gaussian beam analysis (DGBA) based on Gabor expansion. The proposed algorithm utilizing adaptive Gaussian beam matching method is much more efficient than regular decomposition strategy by Gabor expansion. Beam propagation is then calculated by these elliptical Gaussian beams' superposed analytical results, with accuracy comparable with physical optics (PO) theory. This fast algorithm can be suitable for analyzing beam propagation in electrically-large systems, such as reflector antennas and quasi-optical (QO) transforming systems.},

	abstract = {Methods of shaping laser beams within the laser resonator are studied. The simplest form of shaping is the spatial mode generation inherent in the laser cavity due to the geometry of the resonator in conjunction with gain to compensate for roundtrip losses, such as diffraction and output coupling. Typically the fundamental mode or multimode behavior is exhibited from such configurations. Passive mode shaping can be accomplished by introducing static amplitude or phase masks. An example of an amplitude mask is provided in order to generate a higher-order spatial mode. Active mode shaping can be accomplished by altering the optical pump distribution. This case is studied experimentally with a diode-end-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser and compared to modeling of expected Hermite-Gaussian mode generation. Active mode shaping allows the preferred mode distribution to be altered in real time. Additional shaping can be done following the resonator to modify a Hermite-Gaussian mode into a psuedo-Laguerre-Gaussian mode. This work also shows that using the coherent propagation method of Gaussian beam decomposition is capable of modeling and describing intracavity beam shaping.},

Standard methods for coronagraphic simulations involve Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) of very large arrays, and computing power is an issue for the design and tolerancing of coronagraphs on segmented Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT) in order to handle both the speed and memory requirements. Our method combines a semi-analytical approach with non-FFT based Fourier transform algorithms. It enables both fast and memory-efficient computations without introducing any additional approximations. Typical speed improvements based on computation costs are of about ten to fifty for propagations from pupil to Lyot plane, with thirty to sixty times less memory needed. Our method makes it possible to perform numerical coronagraphic studies even in the case of ELTs using a contemporary commercial laptop computer, or any standard commercial workstation computer.},

abstract = {Decomposition of a general arbitrary field into a set of Gaussian beams has been one of the challenges in the Gaussian beam decomposition method for field propagation through optical systems. The most commonly used method in this regard is the Gabor expansion, which decomposes initial fields into shifted and rotated Gaussian beams in a plane. Since the Gaussian beams used have zero initial curvatures, the Gabor expansion method does not utilize the ability of the Gaussian beams to represent the quadratic behavior of the local wavefront. In this paper, we describe an alternative method of decomposing an arbitrary field with smooth wavefront into a set of Gaussian beams with non-zero initial curvatures. The individual Gaussian beams are used to represent up to the quadratic term in the Taylor expansion of the local wavefront. This significantly reduces the number of Gaussian beams required for the decomposition of the field with smooth wavefront and gives more accurate decomposition results. The proposed method directly gives the five ray sets representing the parabasal Gaussian beams, which can then be directly used for propagation of the Gaussian beams through optical systems. To demonstrate the application of the method, we have presented results for the decomposition of fields with strongly curved spherical wavefronts, a cone shaped wavefront, and a wavefront with large spherical aberration. The numerical comparison of the input field with the field reconstructed after the decomposition shows very good agreement in both amplitude and phase profiles. We also show results for the far field intensity distributions of the decomposed wavefronts by propagating in free space using the Gaussian beam propagation method.},

An example of the first on reasonably–priced Intel/Microsoft platforms is used to test whether relevant single-core computational speeds have kept up with predictions, from the early 1990’s 32-bit 486s running extended DOS to today’s 64-bit CPUs running Windows 10. It is found that before around 2005, performance doubled every 18 months (equivalent to 100 times every decade) as predicted by House’s variant of Moore’s 1975 law. At that time thermal issues lead to a more efficient microarchitecture and a relative stagnation of CPU frequencies so progress slowed significantly, but could be mostly reclaimed by the effective utilization of a large number of computational cores. Therefore, previously published results comparing multi-core performance on the other tasks will be updated using nearly a decade newer CPUs and GPUs. Even though they have much higher clock rates and core counts than the old hardware, their relative performances fall short (and sometimes far short) of expectations.},

	abstract = {Pupil mapping is a technique whereby a uniformly illuminated input pupil, such as from starlight, can be mapped into a nonuniformly illuminated exit pupil, such that the image formed from this pupil will have suppressed sidelobes, many orders of magnitude weaker than classical Airy ring intensities. Pupil mapping is therefore a candidate technique for coronagraphic imaging of extrasolar planets around nearby stars. Unlike most other highcontrast imaging techniques, pupil mapping is lossless and preserves the full angular resolution of the collecting telescope. So it could possibly give the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any proposed single-telescope system for detecting extrasolar planets. Prior analyses based on pupil-to-pupil ray-tracing indicate that a planet fainter than 10À10 times its parent star, and as close as about 2k/D, should be detectable. In this paper we describe the results of careful diffraction analysis of pupil-mapping systems. These results reveal a serious unresolved issue. Namely, highcontrast pupil mappings distribute light from very near the edge of the ﬁrst pupil to a broad area of the second pupil, and this dramatically ampliﬁes diffraction-based edge effects, resulting in a limiting attainable contrast of about 10À5. We hope that by identifying this problem, others will provide a solution.},

The telescope, however, is not ideal, given its obscured aperture. Only recently have coronagraph designs been thoroughly investigated that can efficiently work with this configuration. Three coronagraph designs, the hybrid Lyot, the shaped pupil, and the phase-induced amplitude-apodization complex mask coronagraph (PIAA-CMC) have been selected for further development by the AFTA project. Real-world testbed demonstrations of these have just begun, so for now the most reliable means of evaluating their potential performance comes from numerical modeling incorporating diffraction propagation, realistic system models, and simulated wavefront sensing and control. Here we present the methods of performance evaluation and results for the current coronagraph designs.},

These are estimated for the unvignetted field-of-view and the wavelengths of interest. The model estimates an IP of 1.26\% and a CT of 44\% at the Nasmyth focus of the telescope at the wavelength of 0.6 μm at field angle zero with the telescope pointing to zenith. Mueller matrices have been estimated for the primary, secondary, and Nasmyth mirrors. It is found that some of the Mueller matrix elements of the primary and secondary mirrors show a fourfold azimuthal antisymmetry, which indicates that the polarization at the Cassegrain focus is negligible. At the inclined Nasmyth mirror, there is no azimuthal antisymmetry in the matrix elements, and this results in nonzero values for IP and CT, which would negatively impact the polarization measurements at the telescope focus. The averaged Mueller matrix is estimated at the Nasmyth focus at different instrument ports and various zenith angles of the telescope. The variation in the Mueller matrix elements for different coatings is also estimated. The impact of this polarization effect on the science case requirements has been discussed. This analysis will help in achieving precise requirements for future instruments with polarimetric capability.},

The first planned mission is the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI), which will demonstrate key coronagraphic technologies for the first time in space. Early research on WFIRST coronagraph designs focused on overcoming diffraction from the large pupil obscurations. Our latest work has been to optimize coronagraphs at the system level, making them more robust to low-order aberrations from telescope dynamics and polarization aberrations. In this paper, we show how to modify coronagraph optimization formulations to directly suppress sensitivities to low-order Zernike modes, in particular tip/tilt. We find and characterize the trade between throughput and tip/tilt sensitivity for shaped pupil Lyot coronagraphs. For coronagraph designs using deformable mirrors, we find that tip/tilt sensitivity can be improved by one to two orders of magnitude at small working angles without sacrificing any throughput. These results may help WFIRST to overcome residual pointing jitter from its reaction wheels and future large-aperture observatories to be less sensitive to resolved stellar diameters.},

	abstract = {Exozodiacal dust, warm debris from comets and asteroids in and near the habitable zone of stellar systems, reveals the physical processes that shape planetary systems. Scattered light from this dust is also a source of background ﬂux which must be overcome by future missions to image Earthlike planets. This study quantiﬁes the sensitivity of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph to light scattered by exozodi, the zodiacal dust around other stars. Using a sample of 149 nearby stars, previously selected for optimum detection of habitable exoplanets by space observatories, we ﬁnd the maximum number of exozodiacal disks with observable inner habitable zone boundaries is six and the number of observable outer habitable boundaries is 74. One zodi was deﬁned as the visible-light surface brightness of 22 mV arcsec−2 around a solar-mass star, approximating the scattered light brightness in visible light at the Earth-equivalent insolation. In the speckle limited case, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited by speckle temporal stability rather than shot noise, the median 5σ sensitivity to habitable zone exozodi is 12 zodi per resolution element. This estimate is calculated at the inner-working angle of the coronagraph, for the current best estimate performance, neglecting margins on the uncertainty in instrument performance and including a post-processing speckle suppression factor. For an log-norm distribution of exozodi levels with a median exozodi of 3× the solar zodi, we ﬁnd that the Roman Coronagraph would be able to make 5σ detections of exozodiacal disks in scattered light from 13 systems with a 95\% conﬁdence interval spanning 7–20 systems. This sensitivity allows Roman Coronagraph to complement ground-based measurements of exozodiacal thermal emission and constrain dust albedos. Optimized post-processing and detection of extended sources in multiple resolution elements is expected to further improve this unprecedented sensitivity to light scattered by exozodiacal dust.},

NICMOS has a five year mission lifetime with a solid nitrogen dewar that maintains the three 256 X 256 pixel HgCdTe detectors at the operating temperature of 58 Kelvin. Insertion of NICMOS is scheduled for STS Mission 91 in March 1997. The NICOS design is a result of the opportunities and constraints of the HST program which has a unique concept; periodic enhancement of the instrumental capabilities on orbit. This concept, closer to traditional ground based operations, provides a very cost effective capability for new space science opportunities and poses unique challenges in the instrument concepts produced to take advantage of the opportunities.},

NIRCam consists of two optics modules, each with a field of view of 2.2 arcmin square. The modules are identical except for the mechanical layout. Each module consists of two channels divided by a dichroic beamsplitter. The short wavelength channel has a band pass of 0.6 - 2.3 microns, with pixels sized for Nyquist sampling of the PSF at 2.0 microns. The long wavelength channel has a band pass of 2.4 - 5.0 microns, with pixels sized for Nyquist sampling at 4.0 microns. Selections of wide (R{\textasciitilde}4), intermediate (R{\textasciitilde}10), and narrow (R{\textasciitilde}100) bandwidth filters are provided in each of the four channels, along with coronagraphic occulting masks and pupil stops. A refractive optical design results in a smaller instrument volume and mass, provides good images at the pupils for wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, allows good access to the pupils and focal planes, and relaxes the alignment requirements compared to a reflective design. The NIRCam instrument is funded by NASA/GSFC under contract NAS5-02105.},

abstract = {Propagating electromagnetic light fields between nonparallel planes is of special importance, e.g., within the design of novel computer-generated holograms or the simulation of optical systems. In contrast to the extensively discussed evaluation between parallel planes, the diffraction-based propagation of light onto a tilted plane is more burdensome, since discrete fast Fourier transforms cannot be applied directly. In this work, we propose a quasi-fast algorithm (O(N3\&\#x2009;log\&\#x2009;N)) that deals with this problem. Based on a proper decomposition into three rotations, the vectorial field distribution is calculated on a tilted plane using the spectrum of plane waves. The algorithm works on equidistant grids, so neither nonuniform Fourier transforms nor an explicit complex interpolation is necessary. The proposed algorithm is discussed in detail and applied to several examples of practical interest.},

abstract = {The significant optical and size benefits of using a curved focal surface for imaging systems have been well studied yet never brought to market for lack of a high-quality, mass-producible, curved image sensor. In this work we demonstrate that commercial silicon CMOS image sensors can be thinned and formed into accurate, highly curved optical surfaces with undiminished functionality. Our key development is a pneumatic forming process that avoids rigid mechanical constraints and suppresses wrinkling instabilities. A combination of forming-mold design, pressure membrane elastic properties, and controlled friction forces enables us to gradually contact the die at the corners and smoothly press the sensor into a spherical shape. Allowing the die to slide into the concave target shape enables a threefold increase in the spherical curvature over prior approaches having mechanical constraints that resist deformation, and create a high-stress, stretch-dominated state. Our process creates a bridge between the high precision and low-cost but planar CMOS process, and ideal non-planar component shapes such as spherical imagers for improved optical systems. We demonstrate these curved sensors in prototype cameras with custom lenses, measuring exceptional resolution of 3220 line-widths per picture height at an aperture of f/1.2 and nearly 100\% relative illumination across the field. Though we use a 1/2.3\&\#x201D; format image sensor in this report, we also show this process is generally compatible with many state of the art imaging sensor formats. By example, we report photogrammetry test data for an APS-C sized silicon die formed to a 30\&\#x00B0; subtended spherical angle. These gains in sharpness and relative illumination enable a new generation of ultra-high performance, manufacturable, digital imaging systems for scientific, industrial, and artistic use.},

This method uses model fits to nearly in-focus Point Spread Functions (PSFs) to solve for coefficients of the Zernike polynomials describing focus, and in some cases coma and astigmatism. Here, we discuss what these data from the ongoing monitoring strategies and special observations tell us about modes and timescales observed in HST optical variations.},

On the basis of the generalized Collins integral, the propagation formula for a DELGB passing through an axially asymmetrical paraxial optical system is derived through vector integration. The derived formula can be reduced to the formulae for the generalized decentred elliptical Gaussian beam and elliptical Laguerre–Gaussian beam under certain conditions. As an example application of the derived formula, the propagation characteristics of a DELGB in free space are calculated and discussed. As another example, the properties of superposition with a radial array consisting of DELGBs are also studied.}

abstract = {A new kind of light beam called the elliptical Hermite–Gaussian beam (EHGB) is introduced in this paper by using tensor method. The EHGB can be used to describe the generalized higher-order laser beams, such as hollow laser beams and the twisted Hermite–Gaussian beams conveniently. It includes the conventional Hermite–Gaussian beams as special cases. Using the generalized Collins integral, we derive the propagation formula of the EHGB passing through axially non-symmetrical paraxial optical systems. The EHGB allows us to treat the propagation and transformation of some complicated laser beams analytically. As an application example, we treat the elliptical flattened Gaussian beams by expressing it as superposition of a series of EHGBs by using polynomial expansion.}

A new concept of elliptical flattened Gaussian beam (EFGB) is proposed in terms of tensor method, which generalize the original flattened Gaussian beam into 3-dimensional cases. The propagation formula of EFGB through axially nonsymmetric optical system is derived by the generalized Collins integral. By using this formula, the propagation of EFGB in free-space is calculated and discussed. The results show that the flat part of EFGB degenerates during propagation. The beam spots of EFGB rotate with propagation distance. These characteristics are different from that of circular flattened Gaussian beams or elliptical Gaussian beams.}

abstract = {Many applications of ultrashort laser pulses require manipulation and control of the pulse parameters by propagating them through different optical components before the target. This requires methods of simulating the pulse propagation taking into account all effects of dispersion, diffraction, and system aberrations. In this paper, we propose a method of propagating ultrashort pulses through a real optical system by using the Gaussian pulsed beam decomposition. An input pulse with arbitrary spatial and temporal (spectral) profiles is decomposed into a set of elementary Gaussian pulsed beams in the spatiospectral domain. The final scalar electric field of the ultrashort pulse after propagation is then obtained by performing the phase correct superposition of the electric fields all-Gaussian pulsed beams, which are propagated independently through the optical system. We demonstrate the application of the method by propagating an ultrashort pulse through a focusing aspherical lens with large chromatic aberration and a Bessel-X pulse generating axicon lens.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the propagation of coherent light through lens systems; it relates diffraction theory to ray optics. A diffraction integral is derived which relates the electromagnetic fields on the input plane of a lens system to those on its output plane. The kernel of the diffraction integral is written in terms of the elements of the ray matrix that describes the complete lens system; that kernel indicates a connection between ray optics and diffraction theory. It also provides a simple method for writing the diffraction integral for a lens system. The results are limited to the paraxial-ray approximation, but apply to symmetric and asymmetric lens systems. In the case of asymmetric systems, i.e., those containing rotated elliptical or cylindrical lenses, the ray-matrix formalism is extended so as to use a single fourth-order matrix. The diffraction integrals derived are applied to optical spatial filtering, optical-beam waveguides, optical resonators, and holography.},

abstract = {AOtools is a Python package that is open-source and aimed at providing tools for adaptive optics users and researchers. We present version 1.0, which contains tools for adaptive optics processing, including analysing data in the pupil plane, images and point spread functions in the focal plane, wavefront sensors, modelling of atmospheric turbulence, physical optical propagation of wavefronts, and conversion between frequently used adaptive optics and astronomical units. The main drivers behind AOtools is that it should be easy to install and use. To achieve this the project features extensive documentation, automated unit testing and is registered on the Python Package Index. AOtools is under continuous active development to expand the features available, and we encourage everyone involved in adaptive optics to become involved and contribute to the project.},
