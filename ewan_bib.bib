  abstract = {A coronagraph designed for high contrast imaging applications has been experimentally tested using coherent laser light and a vortex mask of topological charge m=2. Intensity contrast values of 95\% were achieved in this first verification of the scheme. Improvements for approaching the theoretical value of 100\% are suggested.}

  abstract = {We present a new phase mask coronagraph consisting in an optical vortex induced by a space-variant surface relief subwavelength grating. Phase mask coronagraphy is a recent technique aiming at accommodating both high dynamic and high angular resolution imaging of faint sources around bright objects such as exoplanets orbiting their parent stars or host galaxies of active galactic nuclei. Subwavelength gratings are known to be artificially birefringent. Their unique dispersive characteristics can be controlled through the grating geometry in order to synthesize achromatic phase shifters. We show that implementing them in a ring-shaped way produces a fully symmetric and achromatic coronagraph without any gap or dead zone. The practical manufacturing of the device is also discussed.},

  abstract = {High-contrast coronagraphy will be needed to image and characterize faint extrasolar planetary systems. Coronagraphy is a rapidly evolving field, and many enhanced alternatives to the classical Lyot coronagraph have been proposed in the past 10 years. Here, we discuss the operation of the vector vortex coronagraph, which is one of the most efficient possible coronagraphs. We first present recent laboratory results and then first light observations at the Palomar observatory. Our near-infrared H-band (centered at \textasciitilde 1.65 {$\mu$}m) and K-band (centered at \textasciitilde 2.2 {$\mu$}m) vector vortex devices demonstrated excellent contrast results in the lab, down to \textasciitilde 10\textendash 6 at an angular separation of \textasciitilde 3{$\lambda$}/d. On sky, we detected a brown dwarf companion 3000 times fainter than its host star (HR 7672) in the Ks band (centered at \textasciitilde 2.15 {$\mu$}m), at an angular separation of \textasciitilde 2.5{$\lambda$}/d. Current and next-generation high-contrast instruments can directly benefit from the demonstrated capabilities of such a vector vortex: simplicity, small inner working angle, high optical throughput ({$>$}90\%), and maximal off-axis discovery space.},
